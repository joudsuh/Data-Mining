# Data Mining Project

A clean, professional, browser-ready repository for a data mining project. This repo contains a cleaned notebook and a Python script generated from your uploaded work.

> **Note:** The dataset is not included. Place your data under `data/raw/` and/or `data/processed/`.

## Project Goals

- Ingest data
- Clean & preprocess
- Explore & visualize
- Train and evaluate models
- Report findings

## Quickstart (Notebook)

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Launch Jupyter and open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/data-mining-project.ipynb
   ```

## Quickstart (Script)

1. Ensure your data files are in `data/raw/`.
2. Run:
   ```bash
   python src/pipeline_from_notebook.py
   ```

## Add Your Data

- Put raw files in `data/raw/`.
- Save any cleaned/intermediate outputs to `data/processed/`.
- Large files should not be committed to Git. Consider adding download instructions to this README if the data is public.

## Reproducing Results

- The notebook is cleaned (no outputs, no magics) for clarity. Re-run cells top-to-bottom.
- The `src/pipeline_from_notebook.py` script contains imports consolidated at the top and a `main()` function wrapping the remaining code. Adapt function boundaries as needed.

## Contributing / Branching

- Use feature branches (`feature/…`) and open Pull Requests.
- Keep commits focused and messages descriptive.

## License

Choose a license (e.g., MIT). Create a `LICENSE` file or pick one via GitHub when creating the repo.
