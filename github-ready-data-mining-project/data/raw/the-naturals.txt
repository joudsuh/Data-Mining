Seriously, a great read! I went through it in less then 24 hours, no joke. It was addicting in the best way, from the push and pull of the love interests with Cassie, the plot twists, and that ending. Oh my god. I just sat there like 'wow' for a solid hour. I highly recommend this book. Definitely one of my favorites!

love the story and the vocabulary used in it. Must read.

This was quite enjoyable. I really liked the chapters where we are reading the killers perspective. The reading style was very good as well, it kept me wanting to read more. Although I didn’t find everything in this book quite realistic, this was a fun read for me.

I was really excited to read this book and found it interesting. However, in my opinion it wasn't as good as everyone else hyped it up to be. Still recommend if you like mystery / thriller.

This book is honestly incredible and I read it in one day I could not put it down. If you’re into criminal minds you’ll love this book, definitely more young adult and the plot twist had be gagged. I didn’t realize this was the same author as the inheritance game which I also loved. I definitely recommend reading this book and I’ll be buying the others from the series :)

Absolutely fantastic can't wait to read the others
