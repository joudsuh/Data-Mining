Good food and service, well done.

My new favorite spot in Zona Metro. Love all the plates we taste. We are a big family so we choose different stuff and share. EVERYTHING SUPPERB. We went twice in a month. And we are going back. It worth the wait. AND THE BREAD!!! Best I've ever taste. Butter es sinfully addictive.

This has been my 3rd visit in little over a month. The food quality has been great, fast and friendly service and great staff. The atmosphere is great, just a bit loud but over all I have enjoyed all three times and will definitely continue to visit.

I recently visited the new Texas Roadhouse location, and overall, it was a fantastic experience! The fried onion was excellent—crispy and flavorful, definitely a must-try. The bread with cinnamon butter was also a highlight, fresh and delicious. The atmosphere was super nice, though a bit on the loud side, which added to the lively vibe. The service was incredibly attentive, with the staff making sure everything was perfect throughout our meal. Portion sizes were very generous, so you'll definitely leave satisfied. The only downside was that parking was a bit tricky since the restaurant is new and popular, but it’s worth the visit. I’ll be back for sure.

The bread was so soft and hot, steak was done perfectly.

I'm not going to comment much on this one... everything was excellent!
