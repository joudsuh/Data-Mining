I really like the service and the food. The staffs are really good & friendly.

Very delicious and distinctive taste, they deserve five stars.

Tasty burger franchise. A little on the expensive side for a simple burger but I gotta say we do go back again and again!!

Good burger and fries. Fried chicken bite was very salty.

I think it's the tastiest burgers ever, the soft bun, the meat and the fillings...

Excellent!
