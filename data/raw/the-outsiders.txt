beautiful!!!! epic!!!! buy it and you won't regret it!! It's AMAZING!!!

I really liked this book for my book report. It was a cool story about a boy and his brothers.

Classic book. Most excellent.

always a good read

I quite literally hated this book all the way through. granted reading this wasn't really my choice.

No offense, but i don't know why people love this book so much. It was boring. And i just really didn't like it. At all.
