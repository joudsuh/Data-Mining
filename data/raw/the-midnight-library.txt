The story is good but the end wasn't satisfying.

The best book ever

There is something left behind the book. In general, excellent

After reading so many raving reviews I decided to grab this book. It was a mistake for me. I found it pretentious and shallow. Maybe it's for you, and that's fine, but don't be so quick to listen to the hype. Read some of the negative reviews as well to make sure this will be something you'll enjoy.

I loved the book, very interesting story

Nice holiday read, easy to read, and difficult to put down. Probably resonates especially with people with lots of regrets in life, it helps put things into perspective. Not the best book I've ever read but I did enjoy it.
