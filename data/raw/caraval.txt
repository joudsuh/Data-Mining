OMG! This book was amazing! Why didn't I read it sooner? I need the second book, like right now!

i genuinely hated every single character. what’s the point of this book? what is this ending? what is this writing? what is going on? i was so bored i got a headache

I really wanted to like this but just couldn’t. Nine months into the year and I’m finally at my first and hopefully last one star read!

Really different from what I usually read. It has fantasy with a mystery. I liked it. Will continue with the series

I really loved this book! It had so many twists and turns throughout with the mystery of what was real or just part of the game. I loved that it had a bit of romance mixed in with everything that was happening
