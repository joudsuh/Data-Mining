Not the best idea to read such a sad book during Christmas!

Beautifully written, but the story isn't for the faint of heart. Interesting yet harrowing insights into Afghanistan's history.

This book made me cry my eyes out! It is beautifully written. It’s refreshing to see the main character: not as the hero, not as the villain. I was a biiit disappointed with the ending (but i don’t want to spoil it).

Even though the texts are skillful and have never seen them, the beautiful scenery of Afghanistan comes to mind.War, friendship, discrimination, and Atonement.I was tearled by the beauty of human beings in the cruelty of society and war.It is an undisputed masterpiece.

It starts off a little slow, but it's a book that leaves a lasting impression on your head for days.

One of the best books I have read. Provides a better understanding of the struggles of the Afghan peoples.
