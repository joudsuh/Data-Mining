A must read for heroes and pirates alike. A great story that can be read in a couple of days.

This book was different at the time, as it had to impress the people. But.. This just doesn't stand up to time and expectations.

From time to time, I pick up this book and read it again. It's such a colorful adventure and is a great escape.

This was perfect read for this gloomy and rainy days. A bit of a reminder of the time when I've read this book, long time ago during my childhood

Good fantasy story, of course a classic. Read Read! Read, read 

I never read this classic as a child and enjoyed it just the same as an adult.
