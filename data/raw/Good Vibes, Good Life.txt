Good philosophy to a better well-being

Cool book to read and good for the shelf

I really enjoy this book. I was trying to find something that inspired me into reading more and this book does that to me.

I’m super excited to read this book later on, I’ve been meaning to get into motivational books and this seems like the perfect stepping stone for that.

I honestly do not know where to begin it’s such a wonderful book.If you’re wondering if you should get it YESSS you should!!!

This is the third self help book I’ve ever read, and because of the great reviews and cute aesthetic I decided to buy it. Personally, i didn’t think it was all that great.
