Beautiful edition. I waited so much to get it. It worth it.

Winn Dixie is a funny, sweet, and poignant, a delight to read. Highly recommended

This book, Winn Dixie, is a wonderful story about a lonely, little girl and her best friend, the dog. Great book for young children.

I never expected the book to be so good.

one of the best books I have recently read

I loved, loved, loved this sad, sweet and delightful story about Opal and her wonderful dog! A must read!
